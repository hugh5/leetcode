"""
Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, 
return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).
The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance i.e., âˆš((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2).
You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).
